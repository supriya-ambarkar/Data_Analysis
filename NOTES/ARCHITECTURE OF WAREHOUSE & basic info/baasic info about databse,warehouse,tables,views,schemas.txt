-> Warehouse provides required resources, such as CPU, Memory, and temporary storage,
to perform the following operations in Snowflake.

-> DataBase is an organized collection of organized data, also called Structured Data.
It can be accessed or stored in a computer system.
	Each Database consists of one or more schemas, which are logical groupings of database objects, such as tables and views.

Different types of Databases:
-------------------------------

1. Relational Database => made of set of table with data that fits into predefines category.s 
2. Distributed Database => database in which portions of database are stored in multiple physical locations and in which processing is dispersed or replicated among different points in a network.
	
Snowflake is cloud technology and it is combination of both databases.

SCHEMA:
-------
->Collection of database objects like tables, triggers,stored procedures,etc
->Each schema belongs to single database.
->Database and schemas are used to organize data stored in Snowflake.

VIEWS:
-------

->Subsset of databse that is generated from user query and gets stored as permanent object.

TABLES:
-------

Tables are databse objects that contain all the data in a database.

LIKE KEYWORD:
-------------

a% - any values that starts with a
%a - any values that ends with a
%word% - any values that has word in any position

_a% - any values that has a in teh second position
a_% - any values that starts with "a" and are atleast 2 chracters in length
a__% - any values that starts with "a" and are atleast 3 chracters in length
a%r - any values that starts with a and ends with r

IN KEYWORD:
------------

IN - OR (CATEGORICAL DATA)
BETWEEN IS USED IN RANGES(CONTINOUS DATA)

AND - A AND B MEANS = BOTH ARE PRESENT
OR - A OR B MEANS = EITHER A IS PRESENT OR B IS PRESENT.
